# Introduction

Welcome to the main documentation for the Amichain ecosystem!

This documentation contains all the essential information you need to understand and effectively utilize our services and tools.  
We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of our ecosystem.

## What is Amichain?

Amichain originates from the AMI (Avax Meme Index) project, which created an index of major meme coins on the Avalanche network.  
As the Avalanche ecosystem has grown, we saw an exciting opportunity to build a new Layer 1 (L1) blockchain that enhances the functionality of meme coin tracking and promotes interoperability with other EVM chains.

Thanks to the powerful tools provided by the Avalanche Foundation, we can now expand our vision and develop a broader and more inclusive index of meme coins.  
Our goal is to integrate seamlessly with existing blockchain ecosystems, allowing users to discover and interact with a wide variety of meme coins across different networks.

In addition to this, we recognized the potential to create new tools focused on interoperability and chain-agnosticism.  
These tools will be designed to work across all EVM chains, including those that will be developed in the future by the community using Avalanche's resources.

## What to expect?

On the current website, you’ll find an overview of our planned projects, all of which are designed to be fully compatible with any EVM-compatible chain.  
Whether you're a developer or a user, you can expect a suite of tools and services that enhance the functionality and accessibility of the blockchain ecosystem.  
Please note that our roadmap is evolving, and details may change as the project progresses.

To begin this journey, we’re going back to basics by focusing on developing common tools that are open-source and usable across all EVM chains.  
Our aim is to provide foundational resources that can be utilized by anyone in the blockchain community, enabling further growth and adoption.

## Contributions

We welcome contributions of all kinds—whether it's ideas, code, or other forms of support. The input from our community is invaluable and plays a pivotal role in the growth and improvement of our project.  
Every contribution, no matter how big or small, has the potential to make a meaningful impact.

We encourage everyone to get involved and contribute in any way they can. Together, we can build something truly innovative and transformative for the blockchain ecosystem.  
Your participation will help shape the future of Amichain and ensure its success.
