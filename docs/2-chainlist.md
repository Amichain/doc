# Chain list

Our chain list consists of a simple directory of chains, including RPC URLs, explorer URLs, icons, and financial data.

## Why another chain list?

Given the expected massive growth of L1 blockchains, we need a simple and effective way to list every chain.

Tools like chainlist.org are wonderful, but they lack several features needed to support a large number of chains.

### Library

Every chain needs to be easily accessible in JavaScript projects (websites, dApps, bots, etc...), which is why we are building a TypeScript chain list library.

### API

Not every app is a JavaScript app, and some may require up-to-date data without the need to update packages. That's why we are building an API based on the JavaScript library.

### App

Users don't have technical skills, so we are building an advanced chain list app that allows them to easily find and manage any chain to their crypto wallet, without any technical effort.
